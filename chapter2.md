  Explain the basics of Python by distinguishing between expressions and names.
  Point out what a function is and how to make a function call. This will
  provoke the concept to modules and Python's dot notation. Ultimately, the
  concept of object-orientated program surfaces, so it is natural to introduce
  the datascience module's Tables as a talking point for a data type.
